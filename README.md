# Unexpected Behavior in useEffect Hook Due to Incorrect Conditional Check

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook where an incorrect conditional check leads to unexpected behavior.  The component renders correctly, but the logic inside the `useEffect` hook does not execute as intended.

## Bug Description
The `useEffect` hook is designed to perform side effects based on changes in dependencies.  However, the conditional check within the `useEffect` function is flawed.  It uses a strict equality (`===`) check against the `count` variable, which may not always evaluate to `true` even if the `count` variable changes and the expected condition is met. This is often a subtle problem in React applications causing hard to debug issues.

## Solution
The solution replaces the strict equality (`===`) check with a loose comparison (`==`) or adjusts the logic to account for other possible states of the `count` variable to ensure the effect runs only under the correct circumstances.
